        <p>Hello!  This is Joyce from Hong Kong.  I am a web developer based in Tokyo with a focus on Ruby and the Ruby on Rails framework. I came to Japan in 2009 and have been living here ever since.  In my free time, I enjoy outdoor activities.  Actually, I'm an avid surfer!  I go surfing whenever possible.</p>
